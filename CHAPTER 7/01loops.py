# CHAPTER 7  â€“ LOOPS IN PYTHON  
# Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program. For instance:  Print 1 
# to 1000. 
# Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer which set of instructions to 
# repeat and how!

#LOOPS

# for i in range(1,6,2):
#     print(i)

# #TYPES
# 1. WHILE
# 2. FOR




### WHILE LOOPS

i = 1

while(i<6):
    print(i)
    i += 1




### FOR LOOPS

for i in range(5):
    print(i)


# RANGE FUNCTION IN PYTHON  
# The range() function in python is used to generate a sequence of number. 
# We can also specify the start, stop and step-size as follows: 
# range(start, stop, step_size) 
# # step_size is usually not used with range()





#SOME IMP STATEMENTS
# break, continue, pass
