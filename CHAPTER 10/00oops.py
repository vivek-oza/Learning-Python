# There are few approaches of doing programming
# 1 procedural approach
# 2 functional approach
# 3 Object oriented approach

#OOP is a way of doing programming, paradigm of programming

# Solving a problem by creating object is one of the most popular
# approaches in programming.
# This is called object-oriented programming

# This concept focuses on using reusable code (DRY Principle).



#Class - blueprint to create obj
#Ex - Exam dena hai

# to form ek kahli form hoga    -(class, sare forms same honge)

# jab form mai bharunga tab vo form mera ho jayega.
# koi or details bharega to form uska ho jayega.    -(Object instantiatino)

#or fir vo bhara hua form object ban jayega (i am object)    -(object)

#ek class ke bhot sare objec ban sakte hai



#Class is only template
#memory alloc only when object initiated



# ##OBJECT

# An object is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined,
# only a template (info) is defined.
# Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

# Objects of a given class can invoke the methods available to it without revealing the 
# implementation details to the user. â€“ Abstractions & Encapsulation!


# # Modelling a problem

# Noun -> class -> employee, animal, language
# Adjective -> Attributes -> name, age, salary
# Verbs -> Methods -> matlab, KUCH KARO, -> getSalary(), talkTuah(), bookTicket(), doSquare()
